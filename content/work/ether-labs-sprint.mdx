## Problem

Ether Labs' staking suite promised high-yield for treasury teams, but jargon-heavy flows stalled onboarding.

## Approach

We organized rapid discovery sprints, prototyped multi-lingual flows, and deployed in-product experiments.

## Outcome

Reworked onboarding, guided messaging, and nurture programs doubled activation and freed the support team to focus on enterprise prospects.
