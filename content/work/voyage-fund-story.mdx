## Problem

Voyage Fund's investment thesis resonated with insiders but failed to land with generalist LPs and founders.

## Approach

We reframed their portfolio impact story, built a cohesive design language, and produced a modular deck and site.

## Outcome

Within six weeks the team closed oversubscribed commitments and a new wave of climate founders entered the pipeline.
