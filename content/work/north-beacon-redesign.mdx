## Problem

North Beacon's platform ingested millions of signals but surface-level dashboards left plant operators guessing. Adoption lagged, and support teams triaged endless help tickets.

## Approach

We embedded with field engineers, ran day-in-the-life studies, and mapped critical workflows. A modular design system equipped product and engineering teams to ship performant views for every role.

## Outcome

The redesigned product launched with priority alerts, scenario planning, and contextual education. Operators now complete daily workflows 47% faster and expansion seats followed suit.
