## Problem

Nova's portfolio of maker-led brands needed a cohesive identity and story ahead of a wholesale expansion push.

## Approach

We developed the shared narrative, brand system, and launch campaign assets that anchored the collective around craft, sustainability, and velocity. A retention program nurtured the top customer cohort.

## Outcome

The launch secured key retail partnerships, carved out a distinct audience, and kept customers engaged through a storytelling-driven lifecycle strategy.
