## Problem

Brightwave's team unified multiple acquired products into a single data activation platform. Their story fragmented across marketing and product, with a dated interface eroding trust with enterprise buyers.

## Approach

We ran a two-week customer research sprint, aligned leadership on a new north-star narrative, and mapped the product experience to the enterprise data maturity curve. Parallel design and copy tracks delivered a component-based marketing site and multi-surface product design system.

## Outcome

The new narrative shipped alongside a modular homepage and in-app onboarding that framed the platform around outcomes and proof. Within the first quarter, demo conversions more than doubled and their average sales cycle accelerated by nearly a month.
