## Problem

Sunset FM wanted to move beyond a static web player and grow recurring memberships.

## Approach

We combined listener research with a modular design system covering mobile, car, and smart display experiences. Growth experiments tested onboarding, session reminders, and loyalty mechanics.

## Outcome

Members now spend triple the time in the product each week and the membership program has scaled to a sustainable revenue channel.
