## Align around outcomes

Every project kicks off with a shared definition of success. We translate goals into instrumentation, qualitative signals, and decision documents.

## Design in the open

We share prototypes daily, record loom walkthroughs, and invite async feedback channels so stakeholders never feel lost.

## Measure and adapt

Experiments, retros, and weekly impact recaps ensure we are learning faster than the market shifts.
